### Mark down code: # for titles, * for bullet signs (not particularly useful)
It's important to save to local directories first before make changes on Github

### Add local contents to Github server
git add Code  # "Code" is the name of local folder
git status
git commit -m "My new code folder 11:20am"  # That's the message added for the folder "Code"
git push # After this, the local folder will be uploaded to Github server

git add . # Add everything in the directory without copying all the file names
git status
gti commit -m "new stuff"
git push

git pull # To pull stuff from repository
